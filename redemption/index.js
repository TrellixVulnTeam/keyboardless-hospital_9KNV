 *    intent request, check the specific type of intent request, etc. 
 * 2) If the above conditions are met, this handler will "handle" the user's request,

/**This hander handles the TestSurvey Intent (AKA the Dr. Brown Appointment SUrvey). It 
 * essentially checks if this is the appropriate handler to handle the TestSurvey intent, 
 * then
 * 1) It checks to see if the dialogState has started (Meaning it checks if no questions have been answered yet.)
 *    a) It calls loadModel() to populate slotOrder
 *    b) initializes the database's fields upon starting the survey. (This will change later 
 *    depending on how we proceed.)
 *    c) Set the current and next slot variables as the first and second field, respectively.
 * 2) If the survey is not complete yet, then we find the slot that was just elicited (if there is one)
 *    and update the database accordingly. We also update the attributes object. Should probably move this
 *    to the next conditional as it shouldn't make a difference.
 * 3) If the survey is in progress, meaning at least one question has been answered, then
 *    a) Check if there is in fact a next slot in the slotOrder. If so, set this as the new currentSlot
 *    b) If there is a next slot after our new current slot, then set that as the next slot, otherwise set
 *       it to null
 *    c) If there is a previous slot before our new current slot, then set that as the previous slot,
 *       otherwise set it to null.
 *    d) If we have reached the end of the survey (we answered the last question), then check here if the
 *       flow has changed. If so, return a response that lets the user know that they have reached the
 *       end of the survey but have not answered all of the questions. It prompts them if they wish to
 *       review it or go back to it later. This will change depending on design decision. This part has not
 *       been built yet.
 * 4) If the survey is incomplete AND the flow has changed (next has been called and original flow
 *    has not been restored), then manually elicit the current slot. This differs with delegating the 
 *    conversation to Alexa since the Alexa will find the first unfilled slot by default and prompt the
 *    user with that. We do not want that; we want the conversation to proceed, thereby making this
 *    conditional necessary.
 * 5) If the survey is incomplete and the the flow has NOT been changed, we continue to delegate the 
 *    converation (and thus, elicitation of slots) to the Alexa.
 * 3) If the dialog state is complete, then the state of the survey is deleted from the attributes
 *    object (not sure if it should be deleted?), and the Alexa will thank the user for their submission
 *    and ask if they want to review their answers, submit, or come back later. This part has not been built yet.
